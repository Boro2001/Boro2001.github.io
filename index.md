### Little bit more about me

My favourite hobbies are basketball and weightlifting. I also like playing on the piano and developing my mathematical skills.

### Project, I took part in: 

Dobblethon - academic project of popular game, Doddle. The project uses speech recognition. 
Link to the project: [**Dobblethon**](https://github.com/AGH-Narzedzia-Informatyczne/dobblethon)
Our goal was to create an interactive game with sound recognition. In few months we menaged to create simple python application. The rules are simple... Who is the fastest wins! I highly recommend trying it out. You'll have great time playing Dobblethon.
